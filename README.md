# 🚀 GSM8K-Teacher-CoT-120B (2025 Release)

**High-Quality Short Chain-of-Thought Distillation Dataset
Plain-Text • No LaTeX • No ChatML • Deterministic Answers**

This repository contains a clean, plain-text **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** dataset distilled from **OpenAI: gpt-oss-120b** using a **strict short-CoT prompt**.
The dataset targets **small reasoning models (1B–7B)** such as **Granite 4.0H**, and follows the **2025 CoT distillation standard**:

* no LaTeX
* no ChatML or markup
* no XML / markdown tokens
* short, deterministic reasoning
* final answers explicitly normalized

---

## 📦 Dataset Overview

* **File:** `gsm8k_teacher_cot.jsonl`
* **Samples:** ~7.2k (full GSM8K train)
* **Format:** JSONL
* **Teacher model:** **OpenAI — gpt-oss-120b**
* **Style:** Short CoT, strict formatting
* **Domain:** Grade-school math problems
* **Intended use:** Training & distillation for small reasoning models

---

## 🧠 Dataset Format

Each line is a JSON object with three fields:

```json
{
  "question": "...",
  "cot": "...",
  "final_answer": "72"
}
```

### **Field descriptions**

* **`question`**
  Original GSM8K problem, plain text.

* **`cot`**
  Short, concise reasoning generated by the 120B teacher.
  No LaTeX, no special formatting.

* **`final_answer`**
  A normalized string containing the final numeric answer.

---

## 🧪 Quality & Style Guarantees

### ✔ Short structured CoT

Always 1–6 sentences, deterministic.

### ✔ No formatting artifacts

No LaTeX, no `$...$`, no markdown, no ChatML tags, no XML.

### ✔ Deterministic output

`final_answer` always present, always a number-as-string.

### ✔ Teacher reproducibility (OpenAI: gpt-oss-120b)

* temperature: **0.2**
* top-p: **1.0**
* max_tokens: **512**
* prompting: **strict short-CoT instructions**
* output constraints: **no LaTeX, no special tokens, plain text only**

---

## 🎯 Intended Use

This dataset is optimized for:

* **Reasoning specialization** for small models (0.5B–3B)
* **Supervised fine-tuning (SFT)**
* **Distillation from a 120B teacher**
* **Math reasoning tasks**
* **Research on compact CoT formats**

Compatible with:

* Hugging Face `datasets`
* Axolotl
* OpenCompass
* LigerTune / ReFT pipelines
* Any SFT trainer using JSONL input

---

## 🔧 Loading Example

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("your-username/gsm8k-teacher-cot-120b")
print(ds["train"][0])
```

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

* The chain-of-thought (`cot`) is **LLM-generated**, not human-authored.
* GSM8K problems are © their original authors; only model-generated reasoning is included.
* Do not treat the CoT as verified mathematics—this dataset is for **training** purposes only.

---

## 📈 Motivation

This dataset was created as part of a 2025 project to train **Granite 4.0H (~1B)** into a competitive reasoning model using:

* high-quality distillation from a 120B teacher
* strict short-CoT supervision
* clean plain-text formatting
* deterministic final answers

The aim is to push the limits of **small-model reasoning** with **minimal, high-signal CoT**.
